# Path to 95%+ Accuracy for Ki-67 Classification

## Current Status (From validation results):
- **InceptionV3**: 90.98% accuracy
- **ResNet50**: 84.96% accuracy  
- **ViT**: 89.47% accuracy
- **Best Ensemble**: 92.29% accuracy

## Path to 95%+ (Recommended Strategy):

### Option 1: Improve EfficientNet Training (RECOMMENDED)
```
Current: 92.3% ensemble â†’ Target: 95%+ 
Gap: Only 2.7% - Very achievable!
```

**Strategy:**
1. **Train EfficientNet-B4/B5** with your current champion script
2. **Add 2-3 more models** (ConvNeXt, RegNet, Swin Transformer)  
3. **Ensemble with optimal weighting**

**Expected outcome**: 95-97% accuracy

### Option 2: Try Vision Transformer (ViT) Variants
- **ViT-Large** (instead of ViT-Base)
- **DeiT-III** (newer, better ViT)
- **BeiT** (BERT-style pretraining for vision)

### Option 3: Try ConvNeXt (Modern CNN)
- **ConvNeXt-Base**: Often outperforms EfficientNet
- **ConvNeXt-Large**: For maximum accuracy

## Recommendation:

**Stick with EfficientNet + Add 1-2 more models**

Your current approach is working well! The gap from 92.3% to 95% is small and achievable by:

1. Training your champion EfficientNet-B4/B5
2. Adding ConvNeXt-Base 
3. Optimizing ensemble weights

This is much easier than switching architectures completely.

## Expected Timeline:
- **EfficientNet-B4 training**: 2-3 hours on T4
- **ConvNeXt training**: 2-3 hours on T4  
- **Ensemble optimization**: 30 minutes
- **Total**: 1 day to reach 95%+

## Confidence Level: **HIGH** 
Your dataset and current performance indicate 95%+ is very achievable with incremental improvements.
