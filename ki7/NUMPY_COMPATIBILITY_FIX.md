# NumPy Compatibility Fix - Champion Training Script

## 🐛 Issue Fixed
**Problem**: `AttributeError: module 'numpy' has no attribute 'int'`

**Root Cause**: The `np.int` alias was deprecated in NumPy 1.20 and completely removed in newer versions.

## 🔧 Solution Applied

### Fixed in `rand_bbox` function:

**Before**:
```python
def rand_bbox(size, lam):
    """Generate random bounding box for CutMix"""
    W = size[2]
    H = size[3]
    cut_rat = np.sqrt(1. - lam)
    cut_w = np.int(W * cut_rat)  # ❌ Deprecated np.int
    cut_h = np.int(H * cut_rat)  # ❌ Deprecated np.int
    # ...rest of function
```

**After**:
```python
def rand_bbox(size, lam):
    """Generate random bounding box for CutMix"""
    W = size[2]
    H = size[3]
    cut_rat = np.sqrt(1. - lam)
    cut_w = int(W * cut_rat)  # ✅ Built-in int()
    cut_h = int(H * cut_rat)  # ✅ Built-in int()
    # ...rest of function
```

## 🎯 Why This Fix Works

1. **Built-in `int()`**: The Python built-in `int()` function works identically to the deprecated `np.int`
2. **No Behavior Change**: This modification does not change any functionality
3. **Future-Proof**: Compatible with all NumPy versions (old and new)
4. **Performance**: Built-in `int()` is actually slightly faster than `np.int`

## 🧪 Testing
- Updated both main script and test script
- Verified compatibility with device placement fixes
- All tests pass successfully

## ✅ Status
- **Fixed**: `np.int` deprecated usage in `rand_bbox` function
- **Verified**: No other deprecated NumPy attributes found
- **Compatible**: Works with NumPy 1.20+ and Google Colab environment
- **Ready**: Champion training script is now fully compatible with modern NumPy

## 🚀 Ready for Colab T4
The script now has:
- ✅ Device mismatch fixes
- ✅ NumPy compatibility fixes
- ✅ T4 GPU optimizations
- ✅ Modern library compatibility

Your champion training script is now fully ready for Google Colab T4! 🎉
