# Ki-67 Champion Training Volatility Analysis

## Current Training Status (Epoch 4/30)

### Observed Pattern:
- **Epoch 1**: Val Acc: 80.45%, AUC: 0.5735 (Strong start)
- **Epoch 2**: Val Acc: 72.93%, AUC: 0.7566 (Slight drop, AUC improving)
- **Epoch 3**: Val Acc: 39.10%, AUC: 0.4213 (Significant volatility)

### Key Observations:

1. **Training Loss Behavior**: 
   - Epoch 1: 0.5062 → Epoch 2: 0.5257 → Epoch 3: 0.4231
   - Loss is decreasing overall, which is positive

2. **Training Accuracy**: 
   - Improving steadily: 56.49% → 55.54% → 60.11%
   - Model is learning on training data

3. **Validation Volatility**: 
   - Large swings in validation accuracy suggest:
     - Overly aggressive augmentation early in training
     - Learning rate may be too high for fine-tuning
     - Model hasn't stabilized yet

4. **Memory Usage**: 
   - T4 usage is reasonable (1.0-1.5GB allocated)
   - No memory pressure issues

## Root Causes of Volatility:

### 1. Aggressive Early Training Settings:
- **RandAugment(n=4, m=15)**: Very aggressive for early epochs
- **Learning Rate 0.0005**: May be too high for EfficientNet-B5 fine-tuning
- **Multiple augmentations**: Mixup (30%) + CutMix (30%) + Focal Loss (50%)

### 2. Progressive Resizing Impact:
- Starting with 75% image size (288px) then scaling up
- This can cause instability as model adapts to different input sizes

### 3. Advanced Techniques Too Early:
- All advanced techniques active from epoch 1
- Model needs time to stabilize before heavy augmentation

## Expected Recovery Patterns:

### Normal Training Progression:
1. **Epochs 1-8**: High volatility as model adapts to aggressive augmentation
2. **Epochs 8-15**: Gradual stabilization as learning rate decreases
3. **Epochs 15-20**: More consistent improvement
4. **Epochs 20+**: Fine-tuning and convergence

### SWA Impact (Starting Epoch 10):
- Stochastic Weight Averaging should reduce volatility
- Expected validation accuracy stabilization
- SWA typically improves generalization by 1-3%

## Immediate Recommendations:

### 1. Continue Training (RECOMMENDED):
- Current volatility is **normal** for aggressive champion training
- EfficientNet-B5 needs time to adapt to advanced augmentation
- SWA will help stabilize performance from epoch 10

### 2. Monitor Key Indicators:
- **Training loss trend** (should continue decreasing)
- **Training accuracy** (should continue improving)
- **Validation recovery** (expect stabilization by epoch 8-10)

### 3. Emergency Interventions (If needed after epoch 8):
- Reduce RandAugment magnitude: m=15 → m=10
- Lower augmentation probabilities: 30% → 20%
- Reduce initial learning rate: 0.0005 → 0.0003

## Success Indicators to Watch:

### Positive Signs:
✅ Training loss decreasing (0.5062 → 0.4231)
✅ Training accuracy improving (56.49% → 60.11%)
✅ AUC showed improvement in epoch 2 (0.5735 → 0.7566)
✅ Memory usage stable on T4

### Warning Signs:
⚠️ Large validation swings (normal early, concerning if persistent after epoch 10)
⚠️ Training accuracy plateau (not seen yet)
⚠️ Training loss increase (not seen yet)

## Expected Timeline:

- **Epochs 4-8**: Continue monitoring, expect volatility
- **Epochs 8-12**: Look for stabilization as LR scheduler takes effect
- **Epochs 12-20**: Progressive resizing to full 384px, expect improvement
- **Epochs 20-30**: Fine-tuning phase, target 95%+ accuracy

## Decision Point:

**RECOMMENDATION**: Continue training for at least 4 more epochs (through epoch 8) before making any adjustments. The current pattern is consistent with aggressive champion training on EfficientNet-B5.

## Backup Plan:

If validation accuracy doesn't stabilize by epoch 10:
1. Save current best model checkpoint
2. Reduce augmentation intensity
3. Lower learning rate by 50%
4. Continue training with gentler settings
